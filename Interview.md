# Levels of Threat Intelligence

Threat Intelligence is categorized into three levels based on its purpose, audience, and technical depth: **Strategic**, **Operational**, and **Tactical**.

---

## 1. Strategic Threat Intelligence

**Purpose**: High-level decision-making based on long-term threat trends.  
**Audience**: Executives, CISOs, policymakers.  
**Focus**: Threat actor intent, geopolitical motives, industry risks.

**Characteristics**:
- Non-technical, narrative style
- Derived from open-source, geopolitical, and industry reporting
- Helps shape security strategies and investment

**Examples**:
- Analysis of APT groups targeting energy sectors in Southeast Asia.
- Reports on the impact of AI in phishing and misinformation campaigns.

# üîç Differentiating Threat Actors, TTPs, IOCs, and IOAs

A structured comparison of four foundational cyber threat intelligence elements.

---

## 1. üß† Threat Actors

**Definition**: Individuals, groups, or entities responsible for malicious cyber activities.

**Key Attributes**:
- **Motivation**: Espionage, financial gain, ideology, revenge
- **Types**:
  - Nation-state (e.g., APT29)
  - Cybercriminals (e.g., FIN7)
  - Hacktivists (e.g., Anonymous)
  - Insider threats

**Example**:  
APT28 (Fancy Bear) is a Russian state-sponsored threat group targeting NATO-related entities using spear-phishing and custom malware.

---

## 2. üõ†Ô∏è TTPs ‚Äì Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures

**Definition**: Describes *how* threat actors operate.

**Structure (MITRE ATT&CK-based)**:
- **Tactic**: Why (goal) ‚Äì e.g., Initial Access
- **Technique**: How (method) ‚Äì e.g., Phishing (T1566)
- **Procedure**: Specific implementation ‚Äì e.g., SMS with fake Okta login link

**Example**:  
- Tactic: Initial Access  
- Technique: Spearphishing via SMS (T1566.001)  
- Procedure: Sending fake Okta login page via SMS to targeted employees

---

## 3. üßæ IOCs ‚Äì Indicators of Compromise

**Definition**: Observable forensic data confirming compromise.

**Types**:
- File hashes (MD5, SHA256)
- Malicious IPs and domains
- Registry keys, malware file names

**Purpose**: Reactive detection (e.g., SIEM, EDR, IDS)

**Example**:  
- IP Address: 185.141.63.120  
- File Hash (SHA256): 34d2d90f7f2b3...  
- Domain: secure-login[.]xyz

---

## 4. üîç IOAs ‚Äì Indicators of Attack

**Definition**: Behavioral patterns indicating intent to attack, even without known IOCs.

**Purpose**: Proactive detection based on behavior and sequence of actions.

**Examples**:
- PowerShell execution triggered by a Word document
- Outlook spawning `cmd.exe` followed by system enumeration
- Suspicious access to LSASS memory from unknown process

---

## üß© Comparison Table

|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Threat Actor**| WHO              | Identity   | Attribution, profiling           | APT29, Lazarus, FIN7                                       |
| **TTPs**        | HOW              | Behavioral | Detection engineering, emulation | Phishing, LOLBins, lateral movement                        |
| **IOCs**        | WHAT (evidence)  | Static     | Reactive detection                | File hashes, malicious domains, registry keys             |
| **IOAs**        | WHAT (intent)    | Dynamic    | Proactive detection               | Word ‚Üí PowerShell, LSASS memory access, unusual process trees |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Threat Actors**: WHO is attacking  
- **TTPs**: HOW they operate  
- **IOCs**: WHAT artifacts prove compromise  
- **IOAs**: WHAT behavior shows attack intent  

All four components work best when combined for layered threat intelligence and defense.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# üéØ How to Collect and Validate Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

The accuracy and timeliness of IOC collection and validation are critical for threat detection, hunting, and incident response. Below is a structured breakdown of how CTI analysts collect and validate IOCs.

---

## üì• 1. IOC Collection Sources

### ‚úÖ **Internal Sources**

| APT Reports                        | Adversary profiling with TTPs & IOCs   |

---

## üìä 2. Types of IOCs Collected

| Category         | Examples                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|

- Remove exact and near-duplicate IOCs.
- Normalize formats (e.g., lowercase domains, hash types).

### üß™ B. **Contextual Analysis**
| Check                         | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Timestamp**                 | Is the IOC recent and relevant?             |
| **False Positives**           | Is the IP/domain used by CDN/VPN/service?   |
| **Frequency Analysis**        | IOC seen once vs. widespread activity        |
| **Behavioral Linkage**        | Is it tied to a known malicious behavior?   |

### üß∞ C. **Tool-Based Validation**
- `VirusTotal` ‚Üí Multi-engine check
- `Hybrid Analysis` / `Joe Sandbox` ‚Üí Behavioral validation
- `Shodan` / `Censys` ‚Üí Validate infrastructure behind IP/domain
- `Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)` ‚Üí Correlation scoring, tagging

### üîê D. **Threat Actor Association**
- Map against known campaigns using:
  - MITRE ATT&CK mappings
  - APT reports (e.g., FireEye, Mandiant, CrowdStrike)
  - Malpedia, ThreatFox

---

## üß† Example Scenario: IOC (IP Address 185.234.219.27)

1. **Check VirusTotal**: Low detection? ‚Üí May be benign or CDN  
2. **Check AbuseIPDB**: Recent malicious reports?  
3. **Correlate via MISP/OTX**: Linked to known malware?  
4. **Check in internal logs**: Has it communicated with internal assets?

If IOC is:
- Seen across multiple sensors and sources
- Behaves maliciously in sandbox
- Matches known TTPs or threat actor infra

‚úÖ **Mark as Validated IOC**  
‚ùå Else ‚Üí Flag as Low Confidence / Watchlist / Discard

---

## üóÇÔ∏è IOC Tagging & Storage

- Store IOCs in MISP, OpenCTI, or TIP
- Tag with:
  - Source reliability (e.g., CISA, OTX, internal IR)
  - Confidence level (High, Medium, Low)
  - TTL (Time to Live) and expiration
  - Linked threat actor or malware family

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Step                   | Action                                       |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Collection**         | Gather from internal + external sources      |
| **Normalization**      | Clean and standardize IOCs                   |
| **Validation**         | Cross-reference, sandbox, context check      |
| **Enrichment**         | Associate with malware, TTPs, actors         |
| **Tagging & Storage**  | Confidence scoring, attribution, TTL         |

---

> High-confidence IOCs fuel detection, hunting, and proactive defense. Avoid blind ingestion‚Äîvalidate before action.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# üîê Closed and Private Threat Intelligence Sources

In addition to open-source intelligence (OSINT), **closed/private intelligence sources** provide higher fidelity, context-rich, and often timely insights into threats. These sources are typically gated by access restrictions, memberships, NDAs, or covert collection methods.
