# AWS Security Best Practices for Protecting Cloud Infrastructure

Securing AWS infrastructure requires a layered, defense-in-depth approach. Below are key best practices categorized into critical domains:

---

## 1. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

- **Use Least Privilege**: Grant users and services the minimum permissions needed.
- **Enable MFA**: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all IAM users, especially root.
- **Avoid Root Account Usage**: Use the root account only for account setup. Create an IAM admin user for daily tasks.
- **Use IAM Roles**: Assign roles to services instead of embedding credentials in code.
- **Implement Permission Boundaries**: Restrict the maximum permissions IAM entities can have.

---

## 2. **Network Security**

- **Use VPC Segmentation**: Separate environments (e.g., prod, dev) using VPCs or subnets.
- **Restrict Inbound/Outbound Traffic**: Use **Security Groups** and **NACLs** to control traffic flow.
- **Use Private Subnets**: Place sensitive workloads in private subnets, expose only necessary services.
- **Enable VPC Flow Logs**: Monitor traffic at the interface level for anomaly detection.

---

## 3. **Data Protection**

- **Encrypt Data at Rest and In Transit**:
  - Use AWS KMS or CMKs for data encryption.
  - Use SSL/TLS for all data in transit.
- **Manage Keys Securely**: Use **AWS KMS** with key rotation enabled.
- **Classify and Tag Sensitive Data**: Use **Macie** for discovering and protecting sensitive data (e.g., PII).

---

## 4. **Monitoring and Logging**

- **Enable CloudTrail**: Audit account activity across AWS services.
- **Use GuardDuty**: Enable for intelligent threat detection using AWS logs and threat intelligence.
- **Enable AWS Config**: Track resource configurations and compliance over time.
- **Centralize Logs**: Aggregate logs to **Amazon S3** or **CloudWatch Logs** with encryption and access controls.
- **Set CloudWatch Alarms**: Alert on abnormal activity (e.g., high API call rates, IAM changes).

---

## 5. **Compute Security (EC2, Lambda, ECS)**

- **Harden EC2 Instances**:
  - Use up-to-date AMIs.
  - Disable unused ports/services.
  - Enable host-based firewalls (e.g., iptables).
- **Use Instance Roles Instead of Hardcoded Credentials**.
- **Use Security Groups to Limit Access** to compute resources.
- **Apply Patch Management** via Systems Manager or automation.
- **Scan Container Images**: Use Amazon ECR image scanning or third-party tools.

---

## 6. **Application Security**

- **Use WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Protect web applications from common exploits.
- **Enable Shield Advanced**: Protect against DDoS attacks for critical workloads.
- **Validate Input/Output**: Always sanitize user input to avoid injection attacks.
- **Use API Gateway with Throttling and Auth**: Apply rate limiting and authentication (e.g., Cognito, IAM) to APIs.

---

## 7. **Incident Response and Recovery**

- **Create an IR Playbook**: Document response steps, roles, and contacts.
- **Test IR Procedures**: Run simulations using AWS Fault Injection Simulator or Chaos Engineering.
- **Enable Snapshot Backups**: Regular backups using AWS Backup or custom scripts.
- **Use Cross-Region Replication**: For disaster recovery and business continuity.

---

## 8. **Compliance and Governance**

- **Use AWS Organizations and SCPs**: Enforce compliance and control services used by accounts.
- **Tag Resources**: For accountability, cost tracking, and automation.
- **Audit Regularly**: Use **AWS Audit Manager** and **Security Hub** for continuous compliance checks.

---

## 9. **DevSecOps Practices**

- **Integrate Security in CI/CD**:
  - Use code scanning tools like **CodeGuru Security**.
  - Scan IaC templates using **CFN-Nag**, **Checkov**, or **Terraform Validator**.
- **Version Control Infrastructure**: Track changes in IaC (CloudFormation, Terraform) in Git.
- **Automate Security Controls**: With Lambda, EventBridge, or AWS Config Rules.

---

## 10. **Cost and Resource Management**

- **Limit Overprovisioned Resources**: Rightsize instances and services.
- **Set Budgets and Alarms**: Prevent unexpected usage spikes.

---

## Conclusion

Security in AWS is a **shared responsibility**. AWS secures the infrastructure; you must secure what's deployed on it. Regular reviews, automated guardrails, and continuous monitoring are critical for strong security posture.

## CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) View

From a CTI perspective, understanding this model helps in:

- **Attributing misconfigurations**: e.g., public S3 bucket is a customer-side misconfiguration.
- **Threat surface mapping**: Define where your team must monitor, harden, and respond.
- **Responsibility delineation in IR**: Understand which party (you vs. AWS) is accountable during incident handling.

---

## 🛡️ Key Takeaway

> **AWS secures the infrastructure. You must secure your workloads, identities, data, and configurations.**

Neglecting customer-side responsibilities leads to common attack vectors like:
- Exposed S3 buckets
- Overprivileged IAM roles
- Misconfigured security groups

---

# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): Overview and Security Best Practices

---

## What is AWS IAM?

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that enables you to securely control access to AWS resources.

- **Users:** Individual identities with long-term credentials.  
- **Groups:** Collections of users with shared permissions.  
- **Roles:** Temporary credentials assigned to services or users.  
- **Policies:** JSON documents defining permissions (Allow or Deny).

---

## IAM Security Threats (Relevant MITRE ATT&CK Techniques)

| Technique ID | Description                             |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| T1078        | Use of valid accounts (stolen creds)  |
| T1550        | Use of alternate authentication methods (access keys, tokens) |
| T1087        | Account enumeration                    |
| T1606        | Forging web credentials               |

---

## IAM Security Best Practices

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege  
Grant only the minimal required permissions and restrict to necessary resources.

Example policy snippet:

{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": "s3:GetObject",
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
}


---

### 2. Use IAM Roles Instead of IAM Users for Applications  
Assign roles to AWS services (EC2, Lambda, ECS) to avoid embedding static credentials.

---

### 3. Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
Require MFA for root account, privileged users, and federated identities.

---

### 4. Monitor and Rotate Credentials  
- Regularly audit and disable unused access keys.  
- Rotate keys periodically.  
- Use AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Access Analyzer for monitoring.

---

### 5. Use Permission Boundaries and Service Control Policies (SCPs)  
- Permission Boundaries limit max permissions on IAM entities.  
- SCPs enforce organization-wide permission guardrails.

---

### 6. Audit and Alert on IAM Events  
Monitor critical events like `CreateUser`, `AttachPolicy`, `AssumeRole`, and `ConsoleLogin` using CloudTrail and AWS Config.

---

### 7. Avoid Using Root Account for Daily Tasks  
- Use root only for initial setup and emergencies.  
- Secure root credentials with strong password and MFA.

---

### 8. Use IAM Access Analyzer  
Detect overly permissive policies and unintended external access.

---

## Real-World Example

**Incident:** An AWS access key leaked on a public repo allowed an attacker to assume roles with permissions like `iam:PassRole` and `s3:GetObject`.

**Mitigation:**  
- Immediate key revocation and rotation.  
- Use CloudTrail logs for incident analysis.  
- Restrict role permissions and implement strict trust policies.  
- Avoid hardcoding credentials; use Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.

---

## Summary

| Practice                   | Purpose                                |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Least Privilege            | Minimize attack surface                |
| IAM Roles                  | Avoid static credentials               |
| MFA                        | Protect against compromised passwords |
| Credential Rotation        | Limit exposure time                    |
| Monitoring & Logging       | Detect and respond to suspicious activity |
| Access Analyzer            | Identify misconfigurations             |
| Avoid Root Usage           | Minimize high-risk access              |

---

**Key Takeaway:**  
IAM is critical for AWS security. Misconfigurations or weak controls expose your environment to unauthorized access and compromise. Enforce strong IAM controls aligned with threat intelligence insights to maintain a secure cloud infrastructure.

## Introduction

Threat hunting in AWS involves proactively searching for signs of compromise, policy violations, or abnormal behaviors across the cloud environment. Two essential native tools for this are:

- **AWS CloudTrail** — Records API activity and user actions.
- **VPC Flow Logs** — Captures network traffic metadata.

Together, they provide deep visibility into operational and network behaviors.

---

## 1. AWS CloudTrail for Threat Hunting

### Description:
CloudTrail logs API calls made through the AWS Management Console, CLI, SDKs, and services.

### What to Hunt:

| Threat Scenario                          | Indicators to Search in CloudTrail                                     |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unauthorized Access**                  | `ConsoleLogin` failures, unusual `AssumeRole`, new `AccessKey` usage   |
| **Privilege Escalation**                 | `AttachRolePolicy`, `PutUserPolicy`, `UpdateAssumeRolePolicy`          |
| **Persistence Mechanism**                | Creation of backdoor IAM users, roles, or policies                     |
| **Data Exfiltration Attempts**           | `GetObject`, `GetParameter`, `GetSecretValue` from sensitive resources |
| **Defense Evasion**                      | `StopLogging`, `DeleteTrail`, `DetachPolicy`                          |

### Hunting Tips:
- Correlate API calls with IAM identities and unusual geolocation.
- Set up Athena queries to detect known attack chains.
- Use `eventSource`, `eventName`, `userAgent`, and `sourceIPAddress` fields for context.

| **Port Scanning / Reconnaissance**       | High volume of connections to multiple ports (low byte count)     |
| **Data Exfiltration**                    | Large outbound data transfers to unfamiliar destinations          |
| **Internal Lateral Movement**            | Unusual east-west traffic between instances                       |
| **Unexpected Protocol Use**              | Connections on uncommon ports/protocols                           |

### Hunting Tips:
- Filter on unusual `srcaddr`, `dstaddr`, and port combinations.
- Monitor for persistent connections over time to external IPs.
- Join with GuardDuty or CTI feeds for IOC correlation.

---

## Combined Use Case: Suspicious EC2 Activity

### Scenario:
An EC2 instance starts making outbound connections to a new IP range.

### Threat Hunt Steps:
1. **CloudTrail:** Check if the EC2 was launched recently or modified.
   - Look for `RunInstances`, `ModifyInstanceAttribute`, or `StartInstances`.
2. **Flow Logs:** Analyze outbound traffic from instance's ENI.
   - Identify if traffic is going to uncommon ports or external IPs.
3. **Correlation:** 
   - Compare destination IPs with threat intelligence (via GuardDuty or MISP).
   - Cross-reference timeframes between API activity and network anomalies.

# Common AWS-Specific Attack Vectors

---

Understanding AWS-specific attack vectors is essential for building a strong cloud security posture. Below is a categorized breakdown of frequent attack scenarios that leverage misconfigurations, over-privileged identities, and service abuse.

---

## 1. **S3 Bucket Misconfigurations**

### Attack Vectors:
- **Public Buckets:** Buckets with `READ`, `WRITE`, or `LIST` access to `Everyone` or `AuthenticatedUsers`.
- **Unencrypted Data:** Absence of SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or client-side encryption.
- **Open Bucket Policies:** Weak or overly permissive bucket policies.

### Threat Impact:
- Data leakage, theft of PII/IP, public exposure of logs or credentials.

### Detection:
- Amazon Macie, AWS Config Rules, S3 Access Analyzer.

---

## 2. **IAM Misconfigurations and Privilege Escalation**

### Attack Vectors:
- **Overly Permissive Policies:** Use of wildcards like `Action: "*"` or `Resource: "*"`.
- **Privilege Escalation via Policy Modification:** Attacker uses `iam:AttachUserPolicy` or `iam:PutRolePolicy` to grant elevated access.
- **Use of Temporary Credentials:** Compromised `AssumeRole` or session tokens.

### Privilege Escalation Examples:
- `PassRole` → Attach elevated role to Lambda or EC2.
- Create new admin user → `iam:CreateUser` + `iam:AttachUserPolicy`.
- Escalate via Lambda → Use `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode` to execute code as elevated principal.

### Detection:
- CloudTrail (for policy changes, `AssumeRole`, or `AttachPolicy` calls), IAM Access Analyzer.

---

## 3. **EC2 Instance Compromise**

### Attack Vectors:
- **Metadata Service Exploitation (pre-IMDSv2):** SSRF to steal IAM role credentials.
- **Public IP Exposure:** SSH/RDP open to the internet.
- **User Data Abuse:** Injection of malicious scripts via instance user data.

### Threat Impact:
- Credential theft, lateral movement, malware deployment.

### Detection:
- VPC Flow Logs, GuardDuty (SSH brute force, EC2 exfiltration), Systems Manager inventory.

---

## 4. **Lambda and API Gateway Exploits**

### Attack Vectors:
- **Excessive IAM Permissions:** Lambda functions with wide IAM access can be hijacked.
- **API Gateway Abuse:** Improper throttling or auth misconfiguration leads to DoS or injection.

### Detection:
- CloudTrail, API Gateway access logs, GuardDuty (malicious Lambda behaviors).

---

## 5. **ECS/EKS Misconfigurations**

### Attack Vectors:
- **Access to Instance Metadata from Containers:** IAM credentials leakage from within containers.
- **Over-privileged Task Roles/Service Accounts:** Privilege escalation via ECS task roles or EKS IAM roles.

### Detection:
- GuardDuty (for container compromise), Config rules, logging IAM actions from containers.

---

## 6. **CloudFormation and Infrastructure Abuse**

### Attack Vectors:
- **Stack Abuse:** Inject malicious templates to create backdoors or extract data.
- **Drift from Secure Baseline:** Overwrite resources to introduce persistence.

### Detection:
- CloudTrail, AWS Config (template drift), IAM role monitoring.

---

## 7. **Abuse of CloudTrail and Logging Services**

### Attack Vectors:
- **Disable/Delete Trails:** Evade detection by stopping CloudTrail or deleting logs.
- **Tampering with Logging Destinations:** Redirect logs to attacker-controlled storage.

### Detection:
- CloudTrail (look for `StopLogging`, `DeleteTrail`, `PutBucketPolicy` on log buckets), Security Hub.

---

## 8. **Exploitation via Serverless Misconfigurations**

### Attack Vectors:
- **Hardcoded Secrets:** Exposing credentials in Lambda environment variables or code.
- **Open Event Triggers:** Public API triggers allowing unvalidated event sources.

### Detection:
- Macie (for secrets in code), Config, manual code review, Lambda logs.

# Investigating a Suspected Compromised EC2 Instance

---

## Objective:
To methodically investigate a suspected EC2 compromise, preserve forensic evidence, identify the root cause, and contain further risk.

---

## Step-by-Step Investigation Approach

---

### 🔒 1. Contain the Instance (without termination)
- **Quarantine:**
  - Detach the instance from its current Security Group.
  - Attach it to a restrictive "Quarantine SG" (no inbound/outbound except for analyst IP).
- **Preserve State:**
  - Do **not** stop or terminate the instance immediately to avoid losing volatile memory (RAM).
  - Take a memory dump if EC2 is Linux (using `LiME`) or Windows (using `WinPMEM`).
- **Snapshot:**
  - Create EBS volume snapshots (OS + data) for offline forensic analysis.
  - Preserve the original volumes unaltered.

---

### 📜 2. Collect Evidence
- **CloudTrail Logs:**
  - Look for suspicious activity: `RunInstances`, `StartInstances`, `CreateUser`, `AttachRolePolicy`, `ConsoleLogin`.
- **VPC Flow Logs:**
  - Review outbound connections to suspicious IPs/domains.
  - Check for lateral movement (east-west traffic).
- **GuardDuty Findings:**
  - Review alerts for known IOCs (e.g., crypto mining, C2 activity, SSH brute force).
- **System Logs:**
  - `auth.log`, `secure.log`, `.bash_history`, Windows Event Logs.
  - Focus on login attempts, privilege escalation, unknown scheduled tasks.
- **Running Processes & Network Connections:**
  - List all running processes (`ps`, `tasklist`) and open connections (`netstat`, `ss`).

---

### 🔍 3. Analyze Artifacts

| Artifact                        | What to Look For                                 |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Startup Scripts**            | Unauthorized changes in `/etc/rc.local`, `cron`, Windows `Startup` |
| **IAM Role**                   | Check if instance role was modified or misused   |
| **New User Accounts**          | Unexpected OS-level or IAM users                 |
| **Installed Software**         | Presence of backdoors, miners, web shells        |
| **File System**                | Data exfiltration traces, staging directories    |
| **Web Logs**                   | Suspicious requests, uploads, encoded strings    |
| **Persistence Mechanisms**     | Cron jobs, scheduled tasks, new services         |

---

### 🧠 4. Threat Intelligence Correlation

- Use IPs, domains, hashes from logs to match against:
  - MISP, VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, ThreatFox
- Correlate TTPs with MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., `Execution > Command and Scripting Interpreter`).

# Forensic Analysis on an EC2 Instance Without Altering Evidence

---

## 🎯 Objective

To perform a **forensically sound investigation** on a potentially compromised EC2 instance while preserving the integrity of original evidence (disk, memory, logs, etc.).

---

## 🧷 Key Principles

- **Do not stop or reboot** the instance (volatile data like memory may be lost).
- **Avoid logging in interactively** unless necessary (to prevent overwriting system artifacts).
- **Collect data remotely and passively** when possible.
- **Snapshot before analysis**, then investigate offline.

---

## 🧰 Step-by-Step Forensic Workflow

---

### 🔒 1. Isolate the EC2 Instance

- **Detach from original Security Group**.
- Attach to a **Quarantine Security Group**:
  - Deny all outbound traffic.
  - Allow only analyst IP for SSH/RDP if required.
- Remove IAM Role if feasible to prevent further abuse.

---

### 📦 2. Create Forensic Copies

| Evidence Type         | Preservation Technique                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Disk (EBS)**         | Use `CreateSnapshot` API or AWS Console       |
| **Memory (RAM)**       | Capture using memory forensics agent (if EDR or SSM agent is installed) |
| **Metadata**           | Collect instance metadata, tags, AMI ID, etc. |

> Always tag the snapshot as “forensic-evidence-[date]” and restrict access via IAM.

---

### 🖥️ 3. Analyze Offline (New Forensic Instance)

- Create a **read-only volume** from the snapshot.
- Attach it to a **forensic EC2 instance** (separate trusted instance).
- **Mount the volume as read-only**:
  - Linux: `mount -o ro /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/forensics`
  - Windows: Use Disk Management to mount as Read-Only

```

------------

### 🔍 4. Examine Artifacts

#### 📁 File System Artifacts:
| Location               | Forensic Value                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `/etc/cron*`, Task Scheduler | Persistence mechanisms                 |
| `.bash_history` / PowerShell logs | Command execution trail          |
| `/var/log/`, Event Logs     | System activity, logins, errors          |
| `/tmp/`, `%TEMP%`          | Malware staging or download locations     |
| Suspicious binaries/scripts | Look for new/unusual files                |

#### 🧠 Memory Artifacts (if RAM dump is available):
- Analyze with **Volatility** or **Rekall**.
- Extract:
  - Running processes
  - Open sockets
  - Injected code
  - In-memory credentials

#### 🌐 Network Artifacts:
- Examine VPC Flow Logs:
  - Lateral movement
  - C2 callbacks
- Analyze active connections from memory (if captured).

---

### 🧠 5. Correlate With Threat Intelligence

- Hash suspicious binaries and check with:
  - VirusTotal
  - MISP
  - AbuseIPDB
- Map TTPs to **MITRE ATT&CK** to understand the actor’s goals.

---

### 📜 6. Maintain a Chain of Custody

- Record:
  - Snapshot IDs
  - IAM access used
  - Timestamps
  - Tools used for analysis
- Keep forensic logs for legal and audit purposes.

---

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

| Practice                      | Description                                       |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **No Changes to Original**    | Use snapshots; never mount original EBS directly |
| **Controlled Access**         | Use strict IAM and security groups               |
| **Volatile Data First**       | Capture memory before stopping instance          |
| **Offline Analysis**          | Use trusted forensic machine                     |
| **Audit Logging**             | Log every forensic action taken                  |

---

## 🧠 Final Note

> In AWS, forensic readiness means building automation around isolation, snapshotting, and artifact extraction **before** the incident occurs. Use Lambda + SSM to automate trusted evidence collection.

Example:  
CIS Benchmark Rule – "Ensure CloudTrail is enabled across all regions":
- Config Rule: `cloudtrail-enabled`

---

## 🔄 3. **Real-Time Alerts + Automated Remediation**

When a resource becomes **non-compliant**:
1. **Config evaluates** it against the rule.
2. Sends alert via **SNS or Security Hub**.
3. **Optional:** Triggers **Lambda or SSM** to auto-remediate.

Example:
```yaml
Trigger: Unencrypted EBS volume detected
Action: Lambda attaches KMS-encrypted copy and deletes unencrypted volume
```

---

## 🧪 4. **Audit & Investigation**

- Provides **change timeline** per resource:
  - What changed?
  - When did it change?
  - Who made the change? (via CloudTrail integration)
- Useful for forensic investigations and compliance audits.

---

## 🧩 Example Workflow

### Scenario: Enforce all EC2 instances must have encrypted volumes

1. **Config Rule:** `encrypted-volumes`
2. **Trigger:** New EC2 instance launched with unencrypted volume
3. **Config marks resource as NON_COMPLIANT**
4. **SNS notification sent** to security team
5. **Lambda triggered** to create encrypted snapshot and replace volume

### 🔹 2. **ThreatFox (Abuse.ch)**

- Pull IOCs (IPs/domains) via JSON API:
  - `https://threatfox.abuse.ch/export/json/recent/`
- Lambda parses and updates:
  - WAF IP sets (for blocking).
  - Route 53 DNS Firewall (malicious domains).
  - GuardDuty IP/domain lists.

### 🔹 3. **AlienVault OTX**

- Use OTX DirectConnect or REST API:
  - Fetch IOCs from curated pulses.
- Extract:
  - IPs, hashes, domains.
- Send to:
  - GuardDuty threat list (S3).
  - Security Hub (custom findings).
  - CloudWatch Events for alerting.

## 🛡️ Sample Use Case

### Scenario: Block known malicious IPs from ThreatFox in real-time

1. Lambda runs every 15 minutes.
2. Fetches latest ThreatFox IPs.
3. Updates AWS WAF IP set.
4. WAF rule blocks HTTP requests from those IPs at ALB/API Gateway.

---

## ✅ Security Best Practices

- **Rate-limit API access** to external TI feeds.
- **Validate IOC freshness** before ingestion.
- **Tag IOCs** with timestamp and source.
- **Limit access** to GuardDuty/WAF configurations using IAM.
- **Use Step Functions** for large-scale IOC processing pipelines.
